Project Overview ðŸŒ±
This project showcases a Crop Disease Detection System that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to predict crop diseases based on images of plant leaves. By simply uploading an image of a diseased plant leaf, the system predicts the type of disease affecting the crop and provides some background information on the disease along with suggestions for remedies.
