Project Overview 🌱
This project showcases a Crop Disease Detection System that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to predict crop diseases based on images of plant leaves. By simply uploading an image of a diseased plant leaf, the system predicts the type of disease affecting the crop and provides some background information on the disease along with suggestions for remedies.


Motivation 💪
Farming is an integral part of economic growth in many countries, especially in regions where the majority of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihood. Technological advancements like Machine Learning and Deep Learning can be implemented to help farmers maximize crop yield and detect diseases early. This project provides an idea of how such technology can assist in precision farming.

Features 🌟
Disease Detection: Upload an image of a plant leaf and the system will predict if the crop is diseased or healthy.
Disease Information: If a disease is detected, the system provides a brief description of the disease along with possible remedies and preventive measures.


Data Source 📊
Disease Detection Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

How It Works 💻
Disease Detection System:
Upload an image of the plant leaf.
The algorithm predicts the crop type and checks if the plant is diseased.
If the plant is diseased, the system will display the disease name, background information, and suggestions for treatment and prevention.

Built With 🛠️
Machine Learning & Deep Learning for disease detection.
Flask for deploying the web application.

Further Improvements 📈
Frontend Design: The user interface can be enhanced for better user experience.
More Data: Expanding the dataset with more plant images could improve the model's robustness and accuracy.
Modularization: Refactor the code to make it more modular and organized.
